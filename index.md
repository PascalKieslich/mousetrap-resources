This repository contains resources for the mousetrap movement tracking suite, a collection of open-source software packages for creating and analyzing movement tracking experiments. The resources are presented separately for the different publications they are supporting (both published and work in progress).


### Kieslich, Henninger, Wulff, Haslbeck & Schulte-Mecklenbeck (2019)

This book chapter provides an introduction to creating mouse-tracking experiments using the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os) and to analyzing mouse-tracking data using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/). The preprint is available in [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/zuvqa/).

In the chapter, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The example experiment is provided as an [OpenSesame file](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_experiment.osexp). The chapter also demonstrates the analysis of mouse-tracking data, for which the analyses scripts are available as [R Markdown (code only)](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.Rmd) and [PDF (code including output)](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.pdf).


### Kieslich & Henninger (2017)

This article presents the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os). It is published in [Behavior Research Methods](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0900-z).

In the article, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The [complete experiment (with German material and instructions)](KieslichHenninger2017/experiment/experiment_german_full_version.osexp) and a [simplified but with regard to the task identical version (with English example material and instructions)](KieslichHenninger2017/experiment/experiment_english_simplified.osexp) are provided. Using this experiment, a study was conducted. The resulting raw data can be found [online](KieslichHenninger2017/merged_data/raw_data.csv.gz). Besides, Kieslich and Henninger (2017) demonstrated a number of simple analyses using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/) for which the analyses scripts as [R Markdown (code only)](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.Rmd) and [PDF (code including output)](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.pdf) are provided as well as a number of [additional analyses](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses_following_Dale_et_al.pdf) following the original analyses by Dale et al. (2007).
