This repository contains a number of resources for creating mouse-tracking experiments and analyzing mouse-tracking data.
They are grouped into different folders for different research projects (both published and work in progress).


### Kieslich, Henninger, Wulff, Haslbeck, & Schulte-Mecklenbeck (2019)

This book chapter provides a tutorial introduction to creating mouse-tracking experiments using the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os), and to analyzing mouse-tracking data using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/). The preprint is available in [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/zuvqa/).

In the chapter, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The [tutorial experiment](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_experiment.osexp) is provided as an OpenSesame file.

Besides, the chapter demonstrates the analysis of mouse-tracking data, for which the [analyses scripts](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.Rmd) and [results](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.pdf) are available here.


### Kieslich & Henninger (2017)

This article presents the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os). It is published in [Behavior Research Methods](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0900-z).

In the article, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The complete experiment (with German material and instructions) and a simplified but with regard to the task identical version (with English example material and instructions) can be found in the [experiment folder](KieslichHenninger2017/experiment).

Using this experiment, a study was conducted. The resulting [raw data](KieslichHenninger2017/merged_data/raw_data.csv.gz) can be found online. Besides, Kieslich and Henninger (2017) demonstrated a number of simple analyses using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/) for which the [analyses scripts](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.Rmd) and [results](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.pdf) are provided as well as a number of [additional analyses](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses_following_Dale_et_al.pdf) following the original analyses by Dale et al. (2007).
