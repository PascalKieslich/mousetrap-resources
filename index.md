This repository contains resources for the mousetrap movement tracking suite, a collection of open-source software packages for creating and analyzing movement tracking experiments. The resources are presented separately for the different publications they are supporting (both published and work in progress).


### Wulff, Haslbeck, Kieslich, Henninger & Schulte-Mecklenbeck (2019)

This [book chapter](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315160559-10) introduces novel methods for identifying and classifying movement trajectories types. These methods are implemented and documented in the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/reference/mousetrap.html#cluster-functions). A preprint of the book chapter is available on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/6edca/).


### Kieslich, Henninger, Wulff, Haslbeck & Schulte-Mecklenbeck (2019)

This [book chapter](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315160559-9) provides an introduction to creating mouse-tracking experiments using the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os) and to analyzing mouse-tracking data using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/). A preprint of the book chapter is available on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/zuvqa/). In the chapter, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The example experiment is provided as an [OpenSesame file](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_experiment.osexp). The chapter also demonstrates the analysis of mouse-tracking data, for which the analyses scripts are available as [R Markdown](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.Rmd) (code only) and [PDF](Kieslichetal2019_chapter/tutorial_analyses.pdf) (code including output).


### Kieslich & Henninger (2017)

This [article](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0900-z) presents the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os). An example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The [complete experiment](KieslichHenninger2017/experiment/experiment_german_full_version.osexp) (in German) and a [simplified version](KieslichHenninger2017/experiment/experiment_english_simplified.osexp) (translated into English) are provided. A study was conducted using this experiment and the [raw data](KieslichHenninger2017/merged_data/raw_data.csv.gz) are used to demonstrate a number of simple analyses with the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/). The analyses scripts are provided as [R Markdown](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.Rmd) (code only) and [PDF](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses.pdf) (code including output). A [separate script](KieslichHenninger2017/KH2017_analyses_following_Dale_et_al.pdf) replicates the original analyses by Dale et al. (2007).
