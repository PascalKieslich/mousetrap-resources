# mousetrap-resources

This repository contains a number of resources for creating mouse-tracking experiments and analyzing mouse-tracking data.

So far, the [raw data](KieslichHenninger2017/merged_data/raw_data.csv.gz) as well as the central [analyses scripts](KieslichHenninger2017/analyses_paper.Rmd) and [results](KieslichHenninger2017/analyses_paper.html) for Kieslich & Henninger (2017) have been added.

More resources will follow soon.
