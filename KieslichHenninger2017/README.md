# Kieslich & Henninger (in press)

This article presents the [mousetrap plugin for OpenSesame](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os). It is published in [Behavior Research Methods](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0900-z).

In the article, an example experiment is created following Experiment 1 by [Dale et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03195938). The complete experiment (with German material and instructions) and a simplified but with regard to the task identical version (with English example material and instructions) can be found in the [experiment folder](experiment).

Using this experiment, a study was conducted. The resulting [raw data](merged_data/raw_data.csv.gz) can be found online. Besides, Kieslich and Henninger (in press) demonstrated a number of simple analyses using the [mousetrap R package](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/) for which the [analyses scripts](KH2017_analyses.Rmd) and [results](KH2017_analyses.pdf) are provided as well as a number of [additional analyses](KH2017_analyses_following_Dale_et_al.pdf) following the original analyses by Dale et al. (2007).
